# BETBY - BACKEND | REST API (BETBY_REST_API)

- Backend application on top of NestJs Framework

## About the project

- Requested message:
  - > Write REST API endpoints to accept requests from Betby.
  - > Save the requested data in a MongoDB database. Use an ORM. Don't worry too much about the logic.
  - > You can show me your code step by step. This means you don't have to deliver the final code in the first step. We use Nest.js as our backend framework.  Use Docker for the MongoDB and Backend repository.
  - > Feel free to ask Reza here in this group chat if you have any questions regarding this.
  - > Just one thing, please keep me updated from time to time. You can send your code or a screenshot. Don't worry if your code isn't perfect right now.
